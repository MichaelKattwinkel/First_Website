# First_Website
This is my first website. 
I had the idea to create a site where you could add verses you wanted to memorize, because a lot of the sites that were similar didn't have features I would have liked.
I used this idea as an opportunity to learn web development.
I haven't added enough features to have the site be fully functional, but it serves it's purpose to get me started with html, css, and javascript.

The site is hosted with github pages at https://michaelkattwinkel.github.io/First_Website/
